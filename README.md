# tubetoiletmap
Creating a tube map that shows what (free) toilets are nearby. Ideally this would also show info in real time (switch over to 
night tube/day tube services).


Idea is to have a home page, allowing you to click through to day tube version, night tube version, or to go to 'live' version. 


Each tube line will be clickable and it'll take you to a screen of a selection of free toilets are within a 100-500m radius of the tube station (not defined the zone yet).  


To be fancy, when you scroll over a tube station, the list of toilets would pop up on the right side of the screen (the tube line would be on the left side of the screen with instructions to scroll over different stations to get the list of toilets). 


To be EVEN MORE super duper fancy, a map would detail the toilet locations.  


Each page should have a form to submit information if you have a toilet suggestion/find some wrong information.  


Social sharing buttons at the bottom of the web pages..Put some bitly thing in there to shrink links? 


Also a link to the radar key scheme/starbucks public toilet kerfuffle?  


Maybe also a link to a 'manifesto'- why we believe spending a penny should be free. This is our about page.


Update:
Background image is of a tube map - maybe add a link to Citymapper (for if you want to plan a visit to the tube station toilets?!)
