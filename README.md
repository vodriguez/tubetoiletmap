# tubetoiletmap
Creating a tube map that shows what (free) toilets are nearby. Ideally this would also show info in real time (switch over to 
night tube/day tube services).


------------------------

Update 2018-11-28:

Home page (index.html)
About page (about.html)
Contact us page (contact.hmtl)
Tube map page (map.html)
Day tube (day.html)
Night tube (night.html)
Live tube (live.html)
404 page?

index.html - ME
  same header as other pages, has buttons along the top to link to the different pages
  
about.html - S
  has same header and buttons as index.html, explains what the project is about (Julie story)

contact.html - A
  same header and buttons as index.html, has a contact form to 'submit' a toilet, not much else? Maybe three pictures of us and a little blurb about us?
  
map.html - ME?
  would have three buttons - linking to day/night/live. 
  
day.html - ME?
  On those three pages you could click the tube and use javascript pop up to display nearest toilets.

night.html - S?
  same header and buttons as index.html, big picture of night tube and a statement that says 'coming soon' (ME has an image for night tube that she has cut out and is using for a button in the map.html page I THINK - could use this?)
  
live.html - A?
  same header and buttons as index.html, if we have time we can make this a proper page but would probably be the same as night.html, if we *do* have time, we can create a class/div thing and update it with the time.
  
404 - S?
  same header and buttons as index.html, but just says 'oops this is doesn't exist' - S, can you ask your developer friend if it's possible to do this?
  
  
Other 
ME - creating images (thank you)
S - asking developer friend to sense check 404
A - sort out my bloody commits!!

I think we should create a new branch for each new page and never merge directly with the master branch, always create a pull request and always request the other two to look at it. If it works, then we can merge it to master (master is getting stronger!)

--------------
Idea is to have a home page, allowing you to click through to day tube version, night tube version, or to go to 'live' version. 


Each tube line will be clickable and it'll take you to a screen of a selection of free toilets are within a 100-500m radius of the tube station (not defined the zone yet).  


To be fancy, when you scroll over a tube station, the list of toilets would pop up on the right side of the screen (the tube line would be on the left side of the screen with instructions to scroll over different stations to get the list of toilets). 


To be EVEN MORE super duper fancy, a map would detail the toilet locations.  


Each page should have a form to submit information if you have a toilet suggestion/find some wrong information.  


Social sharing buttons at the bottom of the web pages..Put some bitly thing in there to shrink links? 


Also a link to the radar key scheme/starbucks public toilet kerfuffle?  


Maybe also a link to a 'manifesto'- why we believe spending a penny should be free. This is our about page.


Update:
Background image is of a tube map - maybe add a link to Citymapper (for if you want to plan a visit to the tube station toilets?!)
