  By the time the tube passed Bank station, Julie was on her third cup of coffee. She fought through the crowd to get off at Liverpool Station but, before she could rush to the Salesforce office for her 9:15am meeting, Julie whipped out her iPhone.
She opened ToiletTube and dashed to the nearest toilet. There's no way she would have made it to her office building and up the elevator bank - thank goodness for ToiletTube!
